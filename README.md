# Film Diary

Welcome to Film Diary, a tool for keeping track of your movie-watching experiences. This application is designed to allow you to track your movie viewing history.

This is a little side project that is a product of my love for movies. Inspired by Letterboxd. Uses JS/React/HTML.

(In case youre interested in the films I enjoyed: https://letterboxd.com/cartile/films/)
## Features
- Add new entries with movie name, rating, and a short review.
- All entries are displayed with the ability to edit and delete them.
- Average rating + total # of entries.
